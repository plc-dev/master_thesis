% Query generation that includes keyword, explain query, but no translation of query present \cite{Do2014AutomaticGO}


% Reverse SQL Question Generation Algorithm (RSQLG), template based generic nlg
% no JOIN, no GROUP BY, checks for exact same querry \cite{Atchariyachanvanich2019ReverseSQ}


% based on \cite{Atchariyachanvanich2019ReverseSQ}, low quality, no joins, no group by, local c app with no binary \cite{Chaudhari2021StructuralQL}


% based on \cite{Atchariyachanvanich2019ReverseSQ}, added DDL \cite{Dwivedi2020AUTOMATICSQ}



% based on context free grammar, theoretical paper, does not actually generate queries \cite{Gudivada2017AutomatedGO}



% identical framework, allows for up to 3 joins, that are pre configured, direct comparison of generated query to user query \cite{10.1145/3436756.3437037, Basse2019OntologyBasedSF}
