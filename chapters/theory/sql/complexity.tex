\textit{Complexity} is an ambiguous concept whose concrete definition is dependent on the context domain. Complexity science can be seen as the \textit{study of the phenomena which emerge from a collection of interacting objects} \cite{johnson2007two}. Applying this definition to SQL-queries, the complexity of a generated SQL-query can be defined as being governed by the following three criteria:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item The number of distinct SQL-keywords that occur in the generated SQL-query.
 \item The number of occurrences of a specific SQL-keyword in a generated SQL-query.
 \item The number of arguments a specific SQL-keyword receives.
 \end{enumerate}
