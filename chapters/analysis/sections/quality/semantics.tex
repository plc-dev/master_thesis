The generated SQL-query shall be semantically plausible regarding \textit{a)} the coherency of the combination of SQL-query-constituents and \textit{b)} the actual meaning of the query objective.

The coherency of the query may be considered semantically plausible if: 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item it doesn't contain redundant constituents,  % group by - distinct
    \item the combination of constituents doesn't contradict the explicit behaviour of one or more other constituents,            % left join with right constraints
    \item every constituent effects the result set.     % left join + right join on n-m 
\end{enumerate}

The query objective may be considered semantically plausible if the query objective is deemed: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item physically feasible by a majority of evaluators,
    \item to adhere to selectional preference in the context of the database schema by a majority of evaluators.
\end{itemize}
